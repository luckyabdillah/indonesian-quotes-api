Hola!ðŸ‘‹ Indonesian Quotes API is a text api that you can use for free! I took a lot of Indonesian quotes from the internet and put them together in this API so that anyone can access them easily. If you'd like to contribute to this small project, that would be great!

## Tech stacks

- Node.js & Express
- TailwindCSS
